Package: OutdoorWaterEfficiencySurvey
Title: Survey Sample Generation and Result Analysis for the CaDC+CivicSpark Outdoor Water Efficiency Survey
Description: This package has two purposes. 

  The first is to document the process used to generate a sample of parcels in the region 
  of the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority (SAWPA). These tax parcels will then be 
  filtered down to single-family households for use in a household survey to estimate 
  current outdoor water use habits, environmental attitudes, and penetration rates of 
  different landscaping types.
  
  The second purpose is to document the analysis of these survey results.
