## Sample Size Calculation

The desired sample size $n_h$ is calculated as: 

$$n_h = (z^2)(r)(1-r)(f)(k)/(e^2)$$

Where

* $n_h$ is the parameter to be calculated and is the sample size in terms of number of households to be selected;

* $z$ is the statistic that defines the level of confidence desired; 

* $r$ is an estimate of a key indicator to be measured by the survey;

* $f$ is the sample design effect, deff, assumed to be 2.0 (default value); 

* $k$ is a multiplier to account for the anticipated rate of non-response; 

* $e$ is the margin of error to be attained.

$r$ is the most important variable for our purposes and at the present time it is uncertain what we should choose for our survey. For example we could choose $r=0.1$ if we believe we are trying to accurately estimate an attribute held by 10% of the population. For now we generate a range of possible values.

```{r}
r <- seq(0.1, 0.9, by=0.1)
r
```


Applying defualts recommended in the handbook for the other values gives:

```{r}
z <- 1.96  # 95% confidence level
f <- 1.5   # assumed design effect from few clusters
k <- 1.25   # 25% nonresponse rate
e <- 0.025 # margin of error desired
```

Our sample size estimates are then

```{r}
nh <- round(((z^2)*r*(1-r)*f*k)/((e^2)))
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(list("r"=r, "sample_size"=nh)))
```

### Sample Size

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ss <- nh[5]

mround <- function(x,base){ 
        base*round(x/base) 
} 

```


For now, we make the conservative estimate of $r = 0.5$, resulting in a desired sample size of `r ss` households visited (although we expect that 1/4 will not respond, so we actually only need completed surveys from `r round((2-k)*ss)` households.)

### Number of Neighborhoods to Visit

Ideally, the `r ss` households would be selected randomly from the population, but that would result in unwieldy logistics for those conducting the survey and an infeasible amount of travel time. Instead we will make use of a two-stage sampling design where neighborhoods (defined by census block groups) are first sampled with a probability proportional to their size, and then a fixed number of households are selected from each neighborhood. 

Determining the correct number of neighborhoods requires making tradeoffs between cost and the amount of variance induced by our sample design. More neighborhoods means more reliable results (lower variance) but also more travel time on the ground. On the other hand selecting fewer neighborhoods with more households in each neighborhood reduces travel time, but increases the variance, thereby reducing the reliability of our ultimate analysis.

To estimate the desired number of neighorhoods to select, we make some assumptions below.
```{r}
ss <- ss # Sample size

num_of_fellows <- 11

hhs_per_hour <- 4 # one of these will be a nonresponse. Assumes
                  # 3*8 mins per survey + 
                  # 4*5 mins to walk to next houses +
                  # 1*3 mins for nonresponse + 11 mins for loading and logistics

volunteers_per_fellow <- 4 #num volunteers managed by each fellow
hours_per_session <- 4 #duration of a volunteer session in hours

neighborhoods_per_session <-  #number of neighborhoods visited each session
travel_time_per_neighborhood <- 0.25 #time in hours to get from one neighborhood to next
travel_time_per_session <- (neighborhoods_per_session-1)*travel_time_per_neighborhood

hhs_per_fellow_per_session <- hhs_per_hour*volunteers_per_fellow*(hours_per_session-travel_time_per_session)
hhs_per_neighborhood <- hhs_per_fellow_per_session/neighborhoods_per_session

```

The assumptions above result in `r hhs_per_fellow_per_session` households visited per fellow per `r hours_per_session`-hour session, assuming that each fellow is coordinating `r volunteers_per_fellow` volunteers and not performing survey's themselves. This results leads to an estimate of `r hhs_per_neighborhood` households to sample from each neighborhood, which we will round to `r mround(hhs_per_neighborhood, 5)`

If this is done, it means that `r round(ss/mround(hhs_per_neighborhood, 5))` neighborhoods will be sampled in total, with `r mround(hhs_per_neighborhood, 5)` households in each, resulting in `r round(ss/mround(hhs_per_neighborhood, 5))*mround(hhs_per_neighborhood, 5)` total households visited.

## Sample Generation

Generation of a sample of households for the Outdoor Water Efficiency Survey. The sample is generated using data stored primarily in the CaDC SCUBA data warehouse.

First connect to the database.
```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RPostgreSQL) 
source("../db_config.R")
db <- dbConnect(RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL(), user=db_user, password=db_password, dbname=db_name, host=db_host, port=db_port)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "db")
```

create table sandbox.parcel_sample_from_notebook_7each as 
(select * from sandbox.parcel_sample_alameda_sawpa_sd_14each limit 0)

create table sandbox.parcel_sample_polygons_7each as
(select a.*, p.geoid, p.region_name 
from assessor_polygons a,
		sandbox.parcel_sample_from_notebook_7each p
where a.assessor_polygon_id = p.assessor_parcel_id)
```

We want the ability to sample our tables, and the easiest wat to do that in Postgres is using the `TABLESAMPLE` command. `TABLESAMPLE` can only be used with actual tables and materialized views, so we will have to forgo our favorite [common table expressions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/queries-with.html) (aka the `with` clause). Instead we create a new materialized view, or refresh it in this case as it has already been created.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sandbox.census_blockgroups_in_sawpa AS (
	SELECT c.*
	FROM census_blockgroup_polygons_2016 c, sandbox.sawpa_boundary_polygon s
	WHERE ST_Intersects(c.geom_3310, s.geom_3310)
)

--REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sandbox.census_blocks_in_sawpa
```
```{sql, connection=db, tab.cap = "Number of census blockgroups in SAWPA"}
SELECT count(*) FROM sandbox.census_blockgroups_in_sawpa
```
Now we have a view of all the 2016 census blockgroups within the SAWPA service area. We can now sample from these to get the first level of our sample. A sample fraction of 1.5% gets us to approximately the number of block groups that we want. 

Next, the sampled block groups are joined with parcel polygons to get a list of all parcels within the sampled block groups. Additionally, these parcels are filtered to only parcels with an area less than 10,000 sqare meters (~2.5 acres). This does a decent, but not perfect job of filtering out large commercial and industrial parcels.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sandbox.parcels_in_blockgroup_sample AS 

WITH sawpa_blockgroup_sample AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM sandbox.census_blockgroups_in_sawpa TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI (1.5) REPEATABLE (1234)
),

parcels_in_blockgroup_sample AS (
  SELECT a.*, b.geoid as blockgroup_id
  FROM assessor_polygons a, sawpa_blockgroup_sample b
  WHERE ST_Intersects(a.geom, b.geom_3310)
  AND a.shape_area < 10000
)

SELECT * from parcels_in_blockgroup_sample
```
```{sql, connection=db, tab.cap = "Number of sampled blockgroups"}
SELECT count(*) 
FROM sandbox.census_blockgroups_in_sawpa TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI (1.5) REPEATABLE (1234)
```
```{sql, connection=db, tab.cap = "Number of parcels in the sampled blockgroups"}
SELECT count(*) FROM sandbox.parcels_in_blockgroup_sample
```

<!-- ```{sql, connection=db, tab.cap = "Number of sampled census blockgroups"} -->
<!-- SELECT blockgroup_id, count(*) as parcel_count  from sandbox.parcels_in_blockgroup_sample -->
<!-- GROUP BY blockgroup_id -->
<!-- ORDER BY parcel_count -->
<!-- ``` -->

Finally, we sample from the parcels within the block groups to get the final household survey sample.
```sql
CREATE TABLE sandbox.hh_survey_sample AS
(SELECT * FROM sandbox.parcels_in_blockgroup_sample TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI (10) REPEATABLE (1234))
```
```{sql, connection=db}
SELECT count(*) FROM sandbox.hh_survey_sample
```
